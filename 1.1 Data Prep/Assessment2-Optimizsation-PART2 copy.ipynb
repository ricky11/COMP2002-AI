    "**Point of interest**: It is assumed that the *stops.csv* file contains coordinates in scientific notation of latitude and longitude.  In an attempt to familiarize myself with the dataset, plotting the stops would visually help in understanding the optimization problem. It was noted that the stops are located near the coast of West Africa, an interesting choice. However when mapping the distances between the stops and tallying the distances with the matrix provided, I was unable to reach the same measurement. It is possible that the distance matrix is stored in a metric other then KM, perhaps earth radius. \n",

    "From the above two graphs we can deduce the following:\n",

    "- In all circumstances, ruin & create destroy the previous solution, even if the parent solution has a improved fitness score.  The solution does not necessarily get better overtime, however as you can see from the Box plot, the minimums for Ruin & Create is on par with Swap and even better then Shuffle, but why? This could be because Ruin & Create is able to escape the *local optima* and explore different regions of the search space, and may randomly reach a *global optima.* However this mutation is generally not recommend on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shuffle & Swap both have a lower mean fitness then Ruin & Create, however due to Shuffles limited perturbation, this causes it to sink into a local optima without escape, which is why you see a higher minimum then Swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example during my tests I found **Swap** to be the best optimizer due to the fact that its overall mean and min fitness after 500 iterations, each staring from a random solution always generated a lower score then the other two optimizers. **\n",
    "  \n",
    "In our test, *Swap* reached a fitness score of about 44 calculated at *np.sum(route_distance) * std_dev*  ensuring that both objectives have been minimized i.e. the travel distance and the evenness of the length. Going forward we can safely assume that in order to calculate the best solution, swap would be the optimal operator to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the Hillclimber is a simple method for optimization for our small dataset, it will usually fall into a local optima and may lead to a suboptimal solution, there is no guarantee of reaching a global optimum. One solution to this is using Crossover which combines genes from two or more parents to escape from these deep dark valleys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is possible that our fitness function has a trade off between equal route length and route distance as this was a Multi-objective optimization problem. In our fitness function we gave equal weight to both distance and route length, *np.sum(route_distance) * std_dev*.  A more optimal solution could have been to add a weighting to one objective, without one objective dominating another. A good solution for route distance, maybe a poor solution for route length and vice versa. \n",
